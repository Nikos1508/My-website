                            with the Arduino microcontroller and 3D prints. In Greece,it's very common for schools to collect plastic 
                            bottle caps, in order to recycle them and get a wheelchair for someone disabled. With this device, there 
                            is no need for a teacher to count them manually! Cap-O-Meter counts each cup thrown in it! During this 
                            project I have made the Arduino contraption and almost every 3D print. </p>
